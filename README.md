# Arsham Hosseinipour's SQL-Portfolio
Hello, and thanks for stopping by! This repository contains examples of SQL I've written for solo projects and while working through SQL, machine learning, and other data analytics courses. Below are a few highlighted projects, including data visualizations I created using PowerBI. Feel free to take a look around and [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arsham-hosseinipour/) if you have any feedback or questions.
# Highlighted Projects
+ **Airbnb Listings Analysis** - [SQL](https://github.com/ArshamHoss/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/airbnb.sql) In this project, I used two datasets found on Kaggle to compare listings in two different cities. Data from Los Angeles and Austin were cleaned and then joined together for better comparison and preparation for visualizations. Tools and Methods such as Normalization, CTEs, Joins, Windows Functions and views were used for data preperation. The analysis of data from the two cities was geard towards prices trends, most relavant amenities, most expensive areas and host locations.
### Airbnb Listings Dashboard - [PowerBI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DfWmHv4VuaHjTDMpFS3LSmzjEQHswXYN/view?usp=sharing)
+ **Data:** Kaggle Los Angeles and Austin Airbnb Listings
+ **Audience:** Airbnb Investors
+ **Purpose:** Make data-driven decisions on what city to invest in
  
In this dashboard, I used data sets from Austin and Los Angeles to provide actionable insights on price trends and the potential of Airbnbs in each city. The dashboard allows my fictional audience to switch between the two states and cities in each state to view various parameters and make data-driven decisions on their Airbnb investment.
